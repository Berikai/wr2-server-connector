## What is the purpose of this?
I know it's an old game, but it's still fun in 2022. I see that the multiplayer tool the game has is now only supporting lan playing. Since it won't give access to connect an host with specific IP, it becomes necessary to use it with a third party VPN applications like Hamachi, RapidVPN etc... 

So I created an multiplayer tool that gives you the power of connecting a specified IP. You can do port forwarding and share your server public, or you can even use services like ngrok to play with your friends without any need of third party software that is not lightweight and that installs their own drivers etc√ß

## How to use it?
Just throw it right into the game folder and launch from there. You're welcome ;)
